- Let's start off my googling about the mod ssl vulnerability,apache server vulnerability, and the samba vulnerability 
- Visit the exploitdb site about Open*uck and note them.
- Also make sure to note the exploit code available in a seperate github link.
- Note the samba exploit given in rapid7 and exploitdb for future exploitation reference.

- One similarity between all these vulnerabilities is its exploit - remote buffer overflow

- Another way to research for vulnerabilities without googling is by using your terminal
	`searchsploit samba 2.2 `
	`searchsploit mod ssl 2`
