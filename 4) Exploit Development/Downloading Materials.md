- Download Vulnserver by googling vulnserver and cloning the github repo into your windows machine.
	- Vulnserver is the vulnerable server that we are going to be attacking.
	- It's going to allow us to write a custom exploit against this and get a reverse shell.
	- Getting a reverse shell means initiating a shell session using listening port to a specific IP in the attacker's machine and get the target machine to connect to the listening attacker machine via TCP protocol.
- Download Immunity Debugger by visiting Immunity Inc
	- Immunity Debugger allows us to run the exploit on this debugger and we can see how it affects the memory, stack, program, etc while running said exploit.
