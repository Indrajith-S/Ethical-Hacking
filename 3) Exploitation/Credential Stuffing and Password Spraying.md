### Credential stuffing
- Credential stuffing is a type of cyberattack where a hacker uses a large database of usernames and passwords obtained from previous data breaches or other sources, to try and gain unauthorized access to user accounts on a different website or platform. The attacker uses automated tools to enter login information and test it against the login page of the target website or platform.
- The goal of the attack is to find the combination of username and password that will grant the attacker access to the targeted account. This can be successful if the user has used the same username and password across multiple platforms.
- Credential stuffing is a significant threat to online security as it allows hackers to gain access to user accounts without having to guess or crack passwords. To protect against credential stuffing attacks, users are advised to use strong, unique passwords for each account and enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. Website owners can also implement security measures such as rate limiting and CAPTCHA to prevent automated login attempts.


### Password Spraying
- Password spraying is a type of cyberattack where a hacker uses a small list of commonly used passwords or commonly used passwords combined with a few targeted usernames to attempt to gain unauthorized access to a large number of user accounts. Unlike brute force attacks, where a hacker tries to guess a user's password by trying every possible combination, password spraying is a more targeted approach that aims to exploit users who are still using weak and commonly used passwords.
- The attack works by trying a small set of passwords against a large number of usernames until the attacker finds a valid combination. This type of attack is often successful because many users still use weak passwords such as "password", "123456", or "qwerty". The attacker may also target a specific organization or industry, using common passwords that are popular in that particular sector.
- To protect against password spraying attacks, users are advised to use strong, unique passwords that are not easily guessable or commonly used. Two-factor authentication can also be an effective defense against these attacks, as it adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username and password combination. Website owners can also implement security measures such as account lockouts and password complexity requirements to prevent successful password spraying attacks.
