- Shell is basically your access to a machine
- Reverse shell simply put is a victim connecting to us

- In a Bind shell (we connect to victim) we open up a port on the machine and then connect to it, ie, we fire up an exploit and exploit goes and opens up a port in the target machine

- Most likely you'll be using reverse shell 95% of the time.
